    <h2>Breakfast That The Entire Family Will Enjoy</h2>
    <p>
      My kids love these chocolate chip pancakes that are light and fluffy and
      loaded with gooey chocolate. You can also sprinkle the chocolate chips on
      top once the pancakes are on the griddle instead of folding them into the
      batter — that way you can adjust the amount of chocolate chips per
      pancake.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>¾ cup milk</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>½ cup mini chocolate chips, or more to taste</li>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To make the buttermilk: Combine milk and vinegar in a bowl and set aside
        for 5 minutes to sour the milk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large
        mixing bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk egg, butter, and vanilla extract into buttermilk mixture until
        well combined; add flour mixture and whisk until just combined. Fold in
        chocolate chips. The pancake batter will be thick. Allow batter to rest
        for 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat, and coat with cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour about ¼ cup of batter for each pancake onto the skillet. Cook until
        bubbles appear on the surface, 2 to 4 minutes. Flip pancake with a
        spatula, and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 more minutes.
        Repeat with remaining batter. Serve immediately.
      </li>
