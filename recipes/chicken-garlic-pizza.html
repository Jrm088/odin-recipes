    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <div class="ingredients">
    <ul>
      <li>1 skinless, boneless chicken breast half</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped green onion</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon dried basil</li>
      <li>1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated pizza crust dough</li>
      <li>2 roma (plum) tomatoes, diced</li>
      <li>½ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
      <li>½ cup ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul></div>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place chicken breast in a saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to
        a boil, and cook until no longer pink, about 20 minutes. Drain and cool
        slightly, then cut into strips.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, in a small skillet over medium heat, melt butter with garlic,
        onion, and basil. Pour into a chilled dish to cool, and refrigerate
        until set.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Roll out pizza dough, place onto a pizza pan or other baking sheet, and
        spread herb butter over surface using the back of a spoon. Arrange
        chicken on top, then dot with ricotta cheese. Top with tomato slices,
        cilantro, and Parmesan cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until crust is browned
        and the center is cooked through.
      </li>
    </ol>
